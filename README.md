- Hi, I’m @zoelin1122
- I’m interested in  the design of smart systems, both artificial and natural, most particularly, in deceptively "dumb" systems that behave intelligently and robustly.
- I’m currently:
      1. Associate Researcher @ Columbia University’s Center of Spatial Research, contributing to the Mapping Historical New York project.
      2. A consultant for the DLI @ Cornell Tech, working on the design and development of Reward Reports, a new AI Documentation framework.
      3. A Data Analyst Fellow @ the Downtown Alliance.
- Open to collaborate on data analytics and data visualization projects.
